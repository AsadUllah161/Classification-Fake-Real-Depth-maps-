# Classification-Fake-Real-Depth-maps
Tested on indoor Nyu dataset for real depth and ICL-NUIM dataset for fake depth

train a nural network for classification.
Mean Squre Error for loss function and use Adam for optimization.

full code is in main.py
GAN.ipng gave you map that is close to real depth
# Requirements
